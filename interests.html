				<p>I've played several sports since I was young, but if I had to choose one that I would love to play, it would have to be badminton.
				Growing up, my sister and I would always play together even though I wasn't very good; in fact I hated it. But since then,
				it has become so important to me and fortunately I've had the opportunity to compete at tournaments and play on my elementary 
				school team.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>I read the Harry Potter series for the first time when I was in the fifth grade. Since then, I've become what many would say, a complete
				Potterhead. The series is so close to me because it was a big part of my childhood and is a common interest between me and my sister; other
				than annoying eachother constantly. To this day, I continue to obsess over it and it is most definitely my favourite book series of all time.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>I'm not the most artistic person, but one of my more art-based interests is sewing. I learnt how to sew a few years ago and have
				learnt how to stich blankets, bags, tailor my own clothes and embroider.</p>
