				<p>Sherlock is one of the best shows I binge-watched during quarantine. It combines wit, cheekiness, mystery and comedy all into one.
				As a huge mystery fan, I personally loved watching it. And as Mr. Holmes would say: I'm not a psychopath, I'm a high functioning sociopath.</p>
				<p>Stranger Things was one of those shows that I was reluctant to watch at first but after seeing it, I realized the hype. Set in the 80s, the 
				show includes sci-fi, mystery and small bits of comedy. Its not a traditional kind of Netflix show but it definitely is worth the watch.</p>
				<p>I can say that I've probably watched the Harry Potter movies over 5 times. The firt time I finished watching the final movie was on 
				New Year's Eve in 2015. I have to admit I was slightly dissapointed with the ending (like how did Harry not fix his wand) but I still
				recommend it whether or not you're a fan.</p>
				<p>A Quiet Place is one of the best horror movies I ever watched because it has such a cool cinematic experience. There is such little
				talking that as an audience, you rely on the graphics to tell the story. It was not only a well crafted movie but the acting made the story
				very believable.</p>
